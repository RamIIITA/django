# django
configurtion for mongodb and postgres

All the code is only configured with python3.6
even virtualenv also created using python3.6 only after other libraries are added

changing python2/3 to python3.6 temporarly in a particular environment

===============================
alias python=python3.6
===============================


KeyNote When ever a new project is going to start:
1) make list of all the tools we are going to use
2) check the compactable version which matches with other libraries also
3) go through only specific library version document 
  Example if you have installed celery 3.6 then go through the celery 3.6 documentation 
  instead of going throught the celery 3.7 or 3.8 documentation
